Humanity is in crisis due to covid-19 global outbreak which is already declared as a pandemic. This is high time we need to get the best of our technology to solve parts of this global crisis and prevent similar crises in future. One of the most difficult challenges for any government of the affected counties is to flatten the curve of infection. Early detection of already affected patients is the most important part to flatten the curve. When a patient is identified as positive, government is trying to obtain close contacts information of the patient through manual processes like, by asking to the friends and family of the affected and so on. However, this approach has many limitations in terms of information accuracy, information retrieval delay etc. due to mostly,

* Falsified information from F&F
* Hidden information by patient and families to avoid social embarrassment
* Unknown or missing information of the patient
* Delayed information retrieval due to manual processes
* And many more
